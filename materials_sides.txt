Contradiction to the source code:
Hope to have source code to ensure security and flexibility
At the same time, I hope that I can use it out of the box, I donâ€™t want to study various details.

Emphasis on flexibility:
Market competition is fierce, trading strategies are changing more and more
Importance: Human efficiency >> Machine efficiency
